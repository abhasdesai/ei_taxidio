	<h1>Multiple Destination Trip & Travel Planner</h1>
<p>
  The fragrance of a foreign soil, the mystery behind a lesser-known alleyway, the grandeur of sculpted monuments and the magnanimity of nature â€“ there is no substitute for traveling. Whether you wander around quiet streets with a cup of coffee in your hand, dive deep into the sea and discover the majestic life beneath, or find yourself hike up a mountain and admire a new city from atop, travel is the best kind of therapy there can ever be. With territorial boundaries receding each day, cultures are mingling together and destinations hidden in the crevices of our globe are waiting to be explored.
